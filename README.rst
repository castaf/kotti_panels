Introduction
============

``kotti_panels`` adds reusable units of content (called panels) to Kotti.

There are two types of panels:

 -  user generated (via Kotti's UI) panels or
 -  developer generated panels that may contain additional application logic,
    e.g. a tag cloud.

Panels can be assigned to slots (the place where they will be rendered) via
Kotti's UI.
