Kotti Panels Documentation
==========================

``kotti_panels`` provides support for reusable units of content in Kotti that
can be defined by either

-   a content manager (via Kotti UI) for "static" content or

-   the developer (by subclassing a base class and using the new
    package's API) for "dynamic" content units - i.e. such that have
    some additional logic.  E.g.: tag cloud, navigation, etc.
